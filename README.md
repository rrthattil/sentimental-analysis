Sentimental Analysis

A simple program to classify various faces and voices to  particular emotional tags and to predict the emotion of an input user face and voice making use of  the classifier model we have prepared from the previous training excersise

To run the program and prepare your own dataset

1) Install dlibs, opencv and essentia libraries
2) Obtain the facial landmark detector, rename it as landmarks.dat and place it in models folder
3) Place the images and voice data in the data library in their appropriate labels
4) Compile the C++ programs in trainers and predictors folder
5) Run the trainer programs to prepare SVM models
6) Run main.py

Done :)
